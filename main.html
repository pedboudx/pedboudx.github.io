                        The webpage titled "Boudoux Electronics" presents a variety of monitors for sale. 
                        The header contains a navigation header with different labels such as Home, New Arrivals, Best Sellers, and Sale. 
                        Each monitor product is displayed with an image, name, specifications, star ratings, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. 
                        Some products are marked as "ON SALE" with discounted prices also showing the original price crossed out.

                    <h4>C++</h4>
                    <p>Console Application built using C++ made for a class project, it aims to emulate the functionality of an online shopping cart using concepts learned in my Object Oriented Programming in C++ class.
                         The program begins with a welcome message, prompting the user to proceed to the list of available items or close the application. If the user chooses to proceed, they are presented with the available items and the number of items in their cart.
                         The user can select an item by entering a corresponding number and view additional information, then they can add the item to their cart or go back. Once the user is finished adding items, they can proceed to view their cart, displaying all items they have added and then prints a receipt in a txt file. </p>

                    <h4>C++</h4>
                    <p>Console Application built using C++, stores and reads user login information from an encrypted file. Upon entering the program, makes the user set a master key which is used every time they open the program in the future. Then presents the user with the options to manage their currently stored login informations, look up a specific website's login information or view the entire list of saved logins. Once the user exits the program, it ensures that all information is encrypted again.</p>
